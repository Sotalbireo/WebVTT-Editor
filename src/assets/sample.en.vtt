<i>Here at Vimeo, there's always 
one thing on our minds:</i>

00:00:08.043 --> 00:00:11.022
<i>how to make your videos 
look amazing, wherever they appear.</i>

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:14.921
<i>The quality of our player 
was already the best in the galaxy,</i>

00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:17.359
<i>but we wanted to make 
the best thing about Vimeo</i>

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.571
<i>even better, so we put 
our best developers and designers</i>

00:00:20.571 --> 00:00:24.014
<i>on the job. They threw around 
a few ideas, and a lot of words,</i>

00:00:24.014 --> 00:00:27.344
<i>words like "future-ready," 
"better sharing,"</i>

00:00:27.344 --> 00:00:31.874
<i>"wider accessibility," 
"singularity," "truth," "beauty."</i>

00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:34.423
<i>They combined all the special 
ingredients that could make</i>

00:00:34.423 --> 00:00:37.415
<i>our platform smarter, 
faster, and more responsive,</i>

00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:39.930
<i>a player that even haters could love.</i>

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.558
<i>After months of work, 
we found the perfect solution:</i>

00:00:43.558 --> 00:00:46.680
<i>a player that worked 
just like the old one, only better.</i>

00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:50.646
<i>Introducing the new Vimeo player.</i>
